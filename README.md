# Quadratic Function Utilities
A very WIP program that (for now) converts Quadratic Functions to other forms.

I made this as a simple test and because I'm too lazy to do my maths homework by hand.

Basically, this program (for now) takes any Quadratic Function in any Form, and converts it to other forms.

*Right now trying to figure out how to add the actual code*
