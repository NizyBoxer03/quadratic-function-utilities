# Quadratic Function Utilities
A very WIP program that (for now) converts Quadratic Functions to other forms.

I made this as a simple test and because I'm too lazy to do my maths homework by hand.

Basically, this program (for now) takes any Quadratic Function in any Form, and converts it to other forms.

# How to build
First, ```cd``` into the sources folder.
Second, build the file using ```make```.

# How to use
If on Windows, either double-click the file or run it from the the Command Prompt.
If on Linux, type ```chmod +x ./QuadraticFunctions``` and then ```./QuadraticFunctions``` to run it
